# Chronos
Exploring potential multivariate solutions for Transformer based time series models.

Initially exploring base capacity of Amazon's Chronos time series LLM model, with an eye toward potential ways to extend it with multivariate forecasting.  More likely, an alternative T5 based model, trained on similar data at higher dimensionality will be necessary for robust projection, but it will be interesting to see what the attention heads will pick up from interlaced parallel streams.

Experiments thus far:
1. Interlace: Built synthetic dataset with two related features as a model for related variables such as asset classes or biological stream feeds; process through Chronos to identify underlying relationships and project both streams into the future.  Streams were interlaced using virtual time interval offsets and a zero-based rest interval between each literal time increment.  Results are promising, as the established base trend projects well, as does the dependent / independent variable relationship.  Scaleability to higher order streams and more complex relationships is of concern, but the initial response indicates that the model may be robust to interlaced analysis.
2. Convolutional Compression: Leveraging real world asset values for gold, bitcoin, and ethereum, train a convolutional model to extract a linear feature set which can feed into Chronos; presented the data to Chronos, with a prediction horizon, then train an inverse decomposition model to extract the independent components from the Chronos prediction.  Results are mixed, as the convolutional model and Chronos projection captured effectively captured and predicted the collective themes, the decomposition process by trained component weights failed to effectively capture the inter-variable complexity; as expected, the decomposition was flat and functionally did little more than re-scale the consolidated trend by asset class.  Further investigation on this front would involve capturing the initial convolutional model weights and directly using their inverse for decomposition; this will likely provide a much more nuanced decomposition map than the initial static weight training process.
3. Signal Convolution: Leverage real world asset values for gold, bitcoin, and ethereum with signal processing layer to combine the streams into a single feature set for Chronos examination.  Convolution and deconvolution of the primary series data works well, and independent variable prediction also projects as expected.  Deconvolution of the projected convolution product, however, is not working due to inability to sync the phase of convoluted component signals and the projected convolution.  As such, the Inverse Fourier Transformation back into the time domain fails to render a meaningful output.
4. Multivariate Post Processing (!!TO DO!!): Implement two step process whereby Chronos projects each parallel stream, then train a FFN network on the data streams to predict the relationships between the streams and thereby modify the dependent stream projection based on its history and the projected parallel asset streams.  This implementation would allow Chronos to levearge its internal quantized learning for projection of parallel streams based on their historical trends, with a separate model to identify the variable interactions which guide the interplay between the projected values based only on internal patterns.

Conclusion: It was hoped that the basic simple time series capacity of Chronos could be extended to multivariat analysis by external processing of the parallel streams.  At least across these three methods employed thus far, the variable interplay is lost when processing through Chronos, thus rendering the output no more useful than parallel projections.  As expected, the signal processing will likely need to be incorporated within a Chronos-like multivariat product which is specifically trained on variable stream densities or range trained on a fixed set of stream counts.
