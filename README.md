# Chronos
Exploring potential multivariate solutions for Transformer based timeseries models.

Initially exploring base capacity of Amazon's Chronos time series LLM model, with an eye toward potential ways to extend it with multivariate forecasting.  More likely, an alternative T5 based model, trained on similar data at higher dimensionality will be necessary for robust projection, but it will be interesting to see what the attention heads will pick up from interlaced parallel streams.
